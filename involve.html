				<h3>Donate Now! <br>You Make a Difference</h3>
				<p>What we do here matters. Our work to study, share, preserve and protect our region’s species has never been more important. But we can’t accomplish this without you! Your gift ensures that we can continue to explore, document and protect our region and share information about the incredibly unique species that call it home.</p>
				<p>Your gift supports so many things – collections, exhibitions, environmental education, and of course, our research that has made The Museum an authority in the flora and fauna of our region. With every project that you support, we learn more about our species and how to meet conservation needs. Without knowledge we cannot conserve, and a surprising amount of the world remains unknown, even areas in our own backyard.</p>
				<h3>You can make a difference in the future of our region by giving today!<br>
